# Credit Default Risk Prediction
Credit card default prediction is crucial for financial institutions to manage risk and maintain financial stability.Defaulting on payments can lead to significant financial losses,so predicting potential defaulters allows banks to take preventive measures,offer tailored credit products and improve customer management.This project leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit card payment for the next month.By utilizing a dataset containing customer information,we build a predictive model to assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk customers effectively.This approach enhances risk management and supports the development of proactive financial strategies.
